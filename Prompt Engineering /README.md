# Prompt Engineering Learning Journey Diary 📖✨

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my learning journey diary! 🚀 I'm diving into the world of prompt engineering, and I'm excited to take you along with me.

## Here's the plan:

- **Basics**: We'll start with the ABCs of prompt engineering, covering all the fundamental stuff.

- **Intermediate**: Moving up a notch, we'll explore the intermediate level, digging into some cool techniques.

- **Advanced**: Brace yourself for the advanced stuff! We'll dive deep into Text generators, Image generators, and other awesome AI tools. You can build your own AI tools too. 

This journey is a work in progress, so bear with me! 🛠️ I promise not to let you down. Your patience is my secret sauce for progress. Stay tuned for updates! 🌟
