## 🧮 Exploring Numeric Types in Python

### 🔢 Integer (Int)

- Represents whole numbers without any decimal.
  - Examples: 8, -42, 0

### 🔟 Floating Point (Float)

- Represents numbers with a fancy decimal.
  - Examples: 3.14, -7.5

## ➕ Basic Arithmetic Operators

| Symbol | Operation       |
| ------ | --------------- |
| +      | Addition        |
| -      | Subtraction     |
| \*     | Multiplication  |
| /      | Division        |
| \*\*   | Exponentiation  |
| %      | Modulus         |
| //     | Floor Division  |

## ✅ Equality and Comparison Operators

Dive into the world of comparing values using Python operators.

- `==` Equal To
- `!=` Not Equal To
- `>` Greater Than
- `<` Less Than
- `>=` Greater Than or Equal To
- `<=` Less Than or Equal To

### 📝 Note on Assignment vs Comparison

- A single `=` is for giving a value to a variable.
- A double `==` is for comparing two values.

### 🧪 Examples Demonstrating Operators

- `3 ** 2` results in 9 (3 raised to the power of 2)
- `5 ** 3` results in 125 (5 raised to the power of 3)

- `21 / 4` results in 5.25 (division)
- `21 // 4` results in 5 (floor division)

## 💬 Comments in Python

Comments are like little reminders in your code that the computer skips.

- Use `#` for short comments on one line.
- Use `"""` for comments that go on and on across multiple lines.
