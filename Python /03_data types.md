# Understanding Python Data Types 📊

## 📝 Data Types

Here's a quick look at different types of data in Python and how you might use them.

| Data Type | Description                          | Example          |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| `int`     | Whole numbers                        | 10               |
| `float`   | Numbers with a decimal point         | 10.5             |
| `str`     | Text; a series of characters         | "Hello, World!"  |
| `bool`    | True or False values                 | True             |
| `list`    | A list that can change (mutable)     | [1, 2, 3]        |
| `tuple`   | A list that can't change (immutable) | (1, 2, 3)        |
| `set`     | Unique items, no duplicates          | {1, 2, 3}        |
| `dict`    | Pairs of keys and values             | {'a': 1, 'b': 2} |

## 🚨 Important to Remember

- Boolean values need to start with a capital letter (`True`/`False`), or they won't work right.
- `None` is Python's way of saying "nothing" or "no value here," and it also starts with a capital letter.

## 🔀 Dynamic Typing

- Python is flexible about changing a variable's type. It's okay to switch the type of data a variable holds.

## 💭 The Concept of None

- `None` is a special type in Python. It's like an empty box or a placeholder for "no value."

## 🔄 Converting Data Types

Sometimes you need to switch data types; here's how:

- `str()` turns things into text strings.
- `int()` turns things into whole numbers.
- `float()` turns things into numbers with decimals.
- `bool()` gives you True or False.
- `list()` makes a list out of something.
- `tuple()` makes a tuple, which is like a list that can't be changed.
- `set()` makes a set, which is like a list with no repeated items.
